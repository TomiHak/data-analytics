# Junior Data Analyst
This is created to show Seriously that I know how to use GitHub and to share some of the work I think is relevant to my job application as a Junior Data Analyst. I really want to work there:)<br>
Here are some examples that I've done while studying.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/TomiHak/data-analytics/blob/main/Sales%20Analysis%20BAI.pbix">Sales Analysis BAI.pbix<a/> file is analytics from sales data using Microsoft PowerBI, it has an animated Scatter chart that im really proud of. If you can't open the file the <a href="https://github.com/TomiHak/data-analytics/blob/main/PowerBIExamples.pdf">PowerBIExamples.pdf.<a/> has screenshots and brief explanations of the work.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/TomiHak/data-analytics/blob/main/Machinelearning_Hakala.ipynb">Machinelearning_Hakala.ipynb<a/> is an excercise where I teach a machine to read handwritten digits by giving it a set of images and their values and making it predict what the last image of the dataset is.<br>
Heres also a link to my Salesforce Trailblazer profile https://trailblazer.me/id/thakala1 As you can see i've already completed a module on reporting and dashboards.<br>
Im also building a chatbot using AI from IBM Cloud for a company, but I can't share that with you yet.

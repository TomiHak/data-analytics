# Junior Data Analyst
This is created to show Seriously that I know how to use GitHub and to share some of the work I think is relevant to my job application as a Junior Data Analyst. I really want to work there:)<br>
Here are some examples that I've done while studying.<br>
PowerBI file is analytics from sales data, it has an animated Scatter chart that im really proud of. If you can't open the file the PowerBIExamples.pdf has screenshots and brief explanations of the work.<br>
Machinelearning_Hakala is an excercise where I teach a machine to read handwritten digits by giving it a set of images and their values and making it predict what the last image is.<br>
Heres also a link to my Salesforce Trailblazer profile https://trailblazer.me/id/thakala1 As you can see i've already completed a module on reporting and dashboards.<br>
Im also building a chatbot using AI from IBM Cloud for a company, but I can't share that with you yet.

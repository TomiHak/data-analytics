# Junior Data Analyst
This is created to show Seriously that I know how to use GitHub and to share some of the work I think is relevant to my application as a Junior Data Analyst. I really want to work there:)
Below are some examples that I've done while studying.
PowerBI file is analytics from sales data, it has an animated Scatter chart that im really proud of.
Machinelearning_Hakala is an excercise where I teach a machine to read handwritten digits by giving it a set of images and their values and making it predict what the last image is.
Heres also a link to my Salesforce Trailblazer profile. As you can see i've already completed a module on reporting and dashboards.
Im also building a chatbot for a company, but I can't share that with you yet.
